## Motivation
1. I wanted to create a website for a local potter to display her work.
2. Everything had to run for free.
3. Needed a process that allowed her to manage the photos herself, AKA no developer help.

React + Flickr Albums + Github pages = [her free website!](https://ogoldberg24.github.io/pottery_site/#/pottery_site/)

## Getting started on flickr.
1. Create an account on flickr.com
2. Obtain your an API key by creating an app in the app garden.
3. Find your user_id by finding the `rest` requests in within the network tab (make sure you are logged in).

## Create react app + github pages. 
1. Install the Github Pages npm package with `npm install gh-pages`
2. Update your package.json to contain these three keys in `scripts`
```js
    "build": "react-scripts build && cp build/index.html",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```
3. Deploy your app to github pages with `npm run deploy`

`NOTE: you cannot deploy from your git account to someone else's github pages! 
Make sure you log in to your end user's account or deployment will fail silently`

## Set a proxy so you can reach the Flickr API
You can deploy [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) with a proxy in your package.json.
Add this key to make API requests to flickr.
```js
  "proxy": "https://api.flickr.com",
```


## Get the associated photos for a page via the Flickr Rest API
I found the `photoset_ids` in the networks tab on the flickr website. 
If you want to programatically find your `photoset_ids` use 
`https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photosets.getList` the same way I've used getPhotos below with the fetch API.

```js
class Planters extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      photoUrls: [],
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    const api_key = "YOUR API KEY"
    const photoset_id = "YOUR ALBUM ID"
    const user_id = "YOUR USER ID"
    fetch(
      `https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/
        ?method=flickr.photosets.getPhotos
        &api_key=${api_key}
        &photoset_id=${photoset_id}
        &user_id=${user_id}
        &format=json&nojsoncallback=1`,
    ) // put the above on the same line (New lined for viewers)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => data.photoset.photo.map(
      photoObj =>
        `https://live.staticflickr.com/
          ${photoObj.server}/${photoObj.id}_${photoObj.secret}.jpg`
      ))
    .then(data => this.setState({photoUrls: data}))
  }
  ...
}
```

Now render it to your photo load mapper. 
```js 
  render() {
    const gallery_obj = []
    this.state.photoUrls.map(
      url => {
        let obj = {
          src: url,
          thumbnail: url,
          thumbnailWidth: 1000,
          thumbnailHeight: 1000,
        }
        return gallery_obj.push(obj)
      }
    )
  ...
  }
```
