It’s <b> July 2002 </b> in the Netherlands.

You hop off a train at the Amsterdam Centraal station.  
You find a ferry to cross the river Amstel, then jump on your bike to ride north for about 
10 minutes on empty bike lanes. Finally, you arrive at the Johan van Hasselt canal in the 
partially developed Amsterdam Noord neighborhood.

</div>


A rusty sign says “The Ceuvel-Volhardig” and behind it appears to be an abandoned shipyard on the 
canal.  Remnants of crumbling boats rest on fractured docks and 
concrete platforms.  You notice that plant life is non-existent and think, “I wonder if the the 
release of harmful metals from antifouling boat paint is harming this ecosystem and creating that 
nasty smell”.    You’ve decided that Amsterdam Noord is no place to start your business. Anyways, 
there is plenty of room in the city center and rent is cheap enough.

It’s <b> July 2014 </b> in the Netherlands.
You push your way off of an overflowing train at the bustling Amsterdam Centraal station.  
The free ferry ride across the Amstel takes you to Amsterdam Noord, where you notice 
the new film museums surrounded by restaurants and businesses as you bike further north.  
It's much busier and more developed than the last time you visited this neighborhood.
You take the same bike trip north and soon you are standing at the inspiring entrance of De Ceuvel.
You proceed through the gate with great curiosity.

### The cafe
Look left, you will notice the cafe. Attractive twenty somethings dressed like the free folk sit on the docks
with their feet in the water.

</div>

They might be working, reading, or socializing. Maybe sipping on local beers, coffees,
or one of the homemade soft drinks made with Elderflower, Ginger-lemon and Rhubarb.  
The crowd is a combination of locals, students, and tourists. Also, hippies
park in small wooden boats by the docks and join the fun.

### The workspaces
Look right, and you see a winding wooden jetty with stops at sustainable planned workplaces for
creative and social enterprises.  They are fitted into houseboats and small wooden buildings. 
The jetty stretches about a half mile, and the two to three person offices along the way
 appear chic and inviting.

There are plants everywhere and it smells great.  You think to yourself
# “What the hell happened here in the last twelve years?”

This area was actually uninhabitable until <b> early 2013. </b> De Ceuvel won the tender 
from the Municipality of Amsterdam and the land was secured for a 10-year lease. A team 
of talented architects, engineers, creatives and social entrepreneurs would go on to build the new 
creative hotspot together.  

The houseboats were acquired for (almost) nothing as it was cheaper for former houseboat 
residents to give up their boat than it was to pay for their removal.  

<div className={styles["diagram"]}>
  <img src={workspace} className={styles["diagram"]} alt="diagram" />
</div>

After choosing the most unique boats, the future tenants renovated the boats themselves. 
Here, the existing features were strengthened and expanded. Many tenants chose to raise their roofs or lower their floors.
 Many of the walls were stripped. After the coarse renovations, the boats were lifted onto 
 De Ceuvel one-by-one with a crane.  On dry land, creative entrepreneurs and volunteers built the jetty, 
 leveled the site, planted the remediating plants (goodbye toxins) and further renovated the boats. 
 Café de Ceuvel was built from an old lifeguarding kiosk and 80-year old nautical bollards from the 
 Scheveningen harbour. 

### Below we explore some of the innovative techniques that power life at De Ceuvel

<div className={styles["diagram"]}>

</div>

## The Heat Exchanger

Each office boat has a heat pump and an air-to-air heat exchange ventilation system. As warm air leaves 
the boat, over 60% of the heat is captured and circulated back inside.
The heat pump extracts heat from the surrounding air to heat up each boat. 
These simple technologies allow them to circumvent the need for a gas connection and use 
renewable electricity to power the heating needs of each boat.

## Helophyte filters

They process wastewater from kitchen sinks in decentralized helophyte filtration systems placed
 adjacent to each office-houseboat. Helophyte filters are simple constructions built using different 
layers. Sand, gravel, and shells help remove solids, and a mix of special plants consumes organic 
matter like nitrogen and phosphorus. Once purified, clean water is then discharged into the ground.

## Phytoremediation

Like many areas of Buiksloterham, the area underneath De Ceuvel is polluted by almost a century of 
heavy industry. Normally such polluted ground is removed and mixed with clean ground, thus moving the
problem to another space. De Ceuvel’s solution is more efficient. A “forbidden garden” was designed by
DELVA Landscape Architects using plants that are known to be particularly good at absorbing these 
pollutants through their roots, a simple technique with a complex name: “phytoremediation”.
The soil between the boats is cultivated and maintained as a Zuiverend Park: a green environment that 
grows specific sets of plants, which absorb, stabilize or exhaust high concentrations of pollution. 
To protect both human and plant-health, they built a raised jetty over the park. Eventually the plants 
will help to leave the ground much cleaner than they initially found it, while in the meantime, as 
De Ceuvel demonstrates, there can be other uses for the space.
Until today, the practice of phytoremediation has only limitedly been used for small, urban areas. 
Zuiverend Park is part of the unique "Cleantech Playground" belonging to De Ceuvel: they aim to 
increase knowledge of this technique in order to improve it, and, ultimately, to transfer their 
experiences to a larger audience. Due to this learning process, their way of cultivating and 
maintaining the park develops over time. The original plan (designed by the Delva Landscape Architects)
only left them with the willows, poplars and some grasses. Since 2016 they have been taking a closer 
look at the plants that spontaneously stem from the polluted soil. They carefully examine their use 
for phytoremediation, while simultaneously sowing plants that are already known for their metal 
absorbing qualities. This combination seems to work out really well!

## Mushrooms

The mushrooms they use are from around de corner.
In former seacontainers on an old industrial zone Wouter Hassing of Mycophilia grows their delicious
shiitake, bolet royal, and oyster mushrooms on wood splinters. The growing itself is also done 
sustainably using a biomeiler: a heap of shredded wood that generates warmth by decomposing. 
Check out the shiitake ceviche.

These clever systems and techniques are inspiring and must be shared with the world. 
As our cities get more and more crowded and expensive, we will need to implement concepts like De Ceuvel’s
at great scale.  Let's stop cramming into tiny rooms in WeWorks at city centers. Also, nobody should be 
thinking about shipping humans to go live on Mars. Let’s follow De Ceuvel’s model and focus on how we can 
flip our own local wasteland into sustainable and thriving cultural and business hubs. 
 
Thank you for reading. If you are in Amsterdam, you have to visit!
